			<h2>Games You Can Print out</h2>
			<p>On this page you will find games that you can print out. Each game has a brief explanation, a link to where I
				originally found the game with a better more detailed explanation, and what type of math I think it would best
				be used for. Games that have “any” for the math skill means that it can work for addition, subtraction,
				multiplication, or division.

				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>Multiplication squares is a game similar to dots and boxes. The game is set up similar to dots and boxes
					where there is a grid of dots and the goal is to make as many boxes as you can by drawing lines between the
					dots but in this version there are numbers in the center of the boxes. You then roll two dice and multiply
					them and draw a line on a box with the answer.</p>
