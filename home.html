			<h2>Games You Can Make With Things Around Your House</h2>
			<p>On this page you will find games that you can make or play with things from around your house. Each game has a
				brief explanation and how to play. There is also a link to where I originally found the game with a better more
				detailed explanation. Also included in the information about each game is what type of math I think it would
				best be used for.</p>

				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>Did you know you can use an egg carton to help teach math? For this game all you need is an egg carton and 2
					small objects. These can be marbles or small blocks or anything similar to that size. First you're going to
					take an empty egg carton and write the numbers 1 to 12 on the bottom of the egg places. Then take the two
					small objects and put them in the carton and shake. Once you open it youâ€™ll have two random numbers to use in
					an equation.</p>
				<p class="c1">Math skill:</p>
				<p>Multiplication but could also be used for subtraction or addition.</p>

			<div class="game2">
				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>For this game you need plastic eggs and a marker. Write a math problem on the longer side and 2 to 3 answers
					on the shorter side for all the eggs you're using and then separate the 2 halves. That's it. Now your child
					can find the matching halve of the egg with the answer.</p>

			<div class="game3">
				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>101 and Out is a game where you try to get as close to 101 without going over. In the game you and your child
					would both roll a die and whatever number you get can either count as a 1 or 10 (so if you roll a 5 it can
					count for 5 or 50) and add it to your total. All you need is 2 dice, a piece of paper, and something to write
					with.</p>

			<div class="game4">
				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>A great way to engage kids is to play a board game with them but with a twist. All you need is a board game(
					in this example it chutes and ladders but any board game will work) and math fact cards. Than instead of
					rolling dice just flip over a math fact card and move the answer.</p>
				<p class="c1">Math skill:</p>
				<p>I think the best is addition but you could mix subtraction and addition cards to do both.</p>
