				<p class="c1">Info:</p>
				<p>This is an adventure game where you can complete various different math problems based on your grade level. I
					personally played Prodigy when I was in elementary school and always really enjoyed it. It is a great way to
					get kids who dislike math to get engaged. The membership does cost money but the program can be really
					beneficial for kids really struggling.</p>

				<p>This game goes based on grade level so it will integrate any math they learn in the grade level they chose.
