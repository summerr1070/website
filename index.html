        <h2 class="titles">About This Website</h2>
        <p>This website is aimed towards parents with kids that struggle in math. On this website you will find two
          surveys at the bottom of the pages that gauge the effectiveness of this website along with pages about the
          most common reasons kids struggle with math and general methods to help them, games made out of things around
          the house, games that require you to print one or more aspects, and online games. The goal of this website is
          to help parents feel better prepared to help their kids.</p>

      <div class="why">
        <h2 class="titles">My Why</h2>
        <p>I chose to make this website because my brother has dyscalculia and growing up I watched how he struggled in
          math. I saw first hand how kids struggle with elementary school math and how that can affect their math skills
          later on in middle and high school. I also saw how hard my mom tried to help my brother but she just didn't
          have the right tools or knowledge. I decided to make this website because I want kids to be able to understand
          math and so parents can feel they can better help their children.</p>
