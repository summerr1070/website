				<h2>Why Math is Important</h2>
				<p>Math is a very important skill to have. A strong foundation in math can mean an increased understanding and regulation of emotions, improved memory, better problem solving skills, better critical thinking, and better quantitative reasoning. Early math skills have also been proven to affect other subjects such as reading and science skills later in life. Mathematics is also used in many different careers such as doctors, cooks,
					government positions, and many more.</p>

				<h2>Overall Help</h2>
				<p>There are a couple ways to help a child struggling in math. The best ways are hands on learning, visuals, connecting it back to concepts they already know, giving positive feedback along with constructive criticism, and to make it fun. I have found that the best way to do this is to use games. It allows kids to engage with content in a fun and hands-on way. Also when they get something wrong or struggle, let them tell you how they got to that answer. This can help you to understand the concepts they do and don't understand along with their logic of how they got that answer.</p>

			<h2>Why Kids Struggle With Math</h2>
			<p>In an article from The Hechinger Report about the effects of disabilities on math, author Jakie Mader says “Nationwide, teachers report that up to 40 percent of their students perform below grade level in math”. Kids have had and continue to have problems understanding math. There are many different reasons for this. Some students struggle with dyscalculia (a neurodevelopmental learning disorder caused by differences in the parts of the brain that are involved with numbers and calculations) or other learning disabilities. Other reasons can be from a simple disinterest in math, a struggle with number sense, math anxiety (the debilitating feeling of fear and failure specifically about math), and not understanding the basics.</p>
